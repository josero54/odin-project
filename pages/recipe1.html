            Weeknight meals can often feel like a chore. 
            Between work, errands, and activities, finding
            the time and energy to cook a healthy and 
            satisfying meal can be a challenge. That's
            where this 5-ingredient tomato soup comes in. 
            This soup is incredibly easy to make, requiring 
            minimal prep and cooking time. It's also packed 
            with flavor and nutrients, making it a perfect
            choice for a busy weeknight.
            </p>

            The key to this soup's simplicity is using canned 
            tomatoes. Canned tomatoes are a lifesaver in the
            kitchen, offering a delicious and convenient way 
            to incorporate tomatoes into your dishes. For this
            soup, you'll want to use high-quality canned tomatoes, 
            such as San Marzano tomatoes. These tomatoes have a 
            richer flavor than your average canned tomato, which 
            will elevate the overall taste of the soup.

            In addition to canned tomatoes, this soup requires 
            just a handful of other ingredients: vegetable broth, 
            garlic, basil, and salt. The vegetable broth adds 
            depth and body to the soup, while the garlic and
            basil provide aromatic and herbal notes. A pinch of 
            salt helps to bring out the natural flavors of the
            ingredients.

            To make this soup, simply combine all of the ingredients 
            in a pot and bring to a simmer. Once the soup has simmered 
            for about 15 minutes, use an immersion blender or regular 
            blender to puree the soupuntil smooth. If you  prefer a 
            chunky soup, you can leave some of the tomatoes unblended. 
            Serve the soup hot with your favorite  toppings, such as 
            grated Parmesan cheese, fresh basil leaves, or a dollop
            of sour cream.
