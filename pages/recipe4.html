            Imagine a delicious and healthy dinner 
            that practically cooks itself. That's <br>
            the beauty of this easy sheet pan roasted 
            Greek salmon and broccoli recipe. This dish <br> 
            requires minimal prep work and cleanup, 
            making it a perfect choice for busy weeknights <br>
            or when you're simply looking for a hassle-free 
            meal.
            </p>
            <p>
            The key to this recipe is using a sheet pan. 
            Sheet pans are incredibly versatile kitchen <br>
            tools that allow you to roast a variety of 
            ingredients at once. This not only saves time <br>
            but also helps to create evenly cooked and 
            flavorful food.
            </p>
            <p>
            For the Greek twist, this recipe uses a simple 
            marinade made with olive oil, lemon juice, <br>
            garlic, oregano, and salt. The olive oil helps 
            to keep the salmon moist, while the lemon <br>
            juice adds a touch of acidity that brightens 
            the flavor. Garlic and oregano provide savory <br>
            and herbaceous notes, and salt enhances the 
            overall taste.
            </p>
            <p>
            To prepare this dish, simply toss the salmon 
            fillets and broccoli florets with the Greek <br>
            marinade. Spread them out on a baking sheet 
            and roast in a preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, <br> 
            or until the salmon is cooked through and the 
            broccoli is tender-crisp. This hands-off approach <br>
            allows you to relax while the oven does all 
            the work.
            </p>
            <p>
            Once cooked, the salmon and broccoli will be 
            beautifully caramelized and bursting with flavor. <br>
            Serve this dish with a side of rice, quinoa, or 
            couscous for a complete and satisfying meal. <br>
