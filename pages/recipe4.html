            Greek salmon and broccoli recipe. This dish 
            requires minimal prep work and cleanup,

            The key to this recipe is using a sheet pan. 
            Sheet pans are incredibly versatile kitchen
            tools that allow you to roast a variety of 
            ingredients at once. This not only saves time
            but also helps to create evenly cooked and 
            flavorful food.

            For the Greek twist, this recipe uses a simple 
            marinade made with olive oil, lemon juice,
            garlic, oregano, and salt. The olive oil helps 
            to keep the salmon moist, while the lemon
            juice adds a touch of acidity that brightens 
            the flavor. Garlic and oregano provide savory
            and herbaceous notes, and salt enhances the 
            overall taste.

            To prepare this dish, simply toss the salmon 
            fillets and broccoli florets with the Greek
            marinade. Spread them out on a baking sheet 
            and roast in a preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, 
            or until the salmon is cooked through and the 
            broccoli is tender-crisp. This hands-off approach
            allows you to relax while the oven does all 
            the work.
            </p>
            <p>
            Once cooked, the salmon and broccoli will be 
            beautifully caramelized and bursting with flavor.
            Serve this dish with a side of rice, quinoa, or 
            couscous for a complete and satisfying meal.
