        <p>
            Craving a comforting and flavorful vegetarian 
            meal that comes together in a single pot? Look <br>
            no further than this one-pot spinach mushroom 
            pasta. This recipe is incredibly easy to make, <br>
            requiring minimal prep and just one pot for 
            cooking. It's also packed with nutrients and <br>
            flavor, making it a perfect choice for a quick 
            and satisfying weeknight dinner.
            </p>
            <p>
            The base of this dish is built on a simple 
            combination of olive oil, onion, and garlic. <br>
            Saut√©ing these ingredients together creates a 
            flavorful base that infuses the entire dish. <br>
            Next, we add sliced mushrooms, which cook down 
            and release their earthy flavor. You can use any <br>
            type of mushroom you like, such as cremini 
            mushrooms, portobello mushrooms, or a combination <br>
            for added variety.
            </p>
            <p>
            For a pop of color and freshness, we incorporate 
            spinach. Spinach cooks down quickly and wilts easily, <br>
            adding a touch of bitterness that balances 
            the other flavors in the dish. You can use fresh <br>
            spinach or frozen spinach for this recipe. If using 
            frozen spinach, be sure to thaw and squeeze out any <br>
            excess moisture before adding it to the pot.
            </p>
            <p>
            Finally, we add the pasta, vegetable broth, and 
            Parmesan cheese. The vegetable broth adds depth and <br>
            body to the sauce, while the Parmesan cheese provides 
            a salty and nutty flavor that ties everything together. <br>
            The pasta cooks directly in the pot with all the other 
            ingredients, eliminating the need for a separate pot <br>
            of boiling water.
            </p>
            <p>
            Once the pasta is cooked through and the sauce has 
            thickened slightly, your one-pot spinach mushroom <br>
            pasta is ready to serve. Top it with additional 
            Parmesan cheese, red pepper flakes, or a drizzle <br>
            of olive oil for extra flavor and enjoy!
